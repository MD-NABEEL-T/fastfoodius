🍔 Fast & Foodious – Feature Breakdown (with Logic)
1️⃣ Landing Page (Home Page)

What it does:
Shows a clean intro page with app branding and an “Order Now” button.

How it works:
Firebase Hosting always loads index.html first, which is designed as the home page and routes users to the student ordering page.

2️⃣ Student Ordering Page

How it works:
Each menu item has + / - buttons that update a numeric input field using JavaScript event listeners.

Lets users switch between different food categories without reloading the page.

How it works:
Bootstrap tab components show/hide content sections using data attributes and CSS classes.

4️⃣ Generate Bill Button

What it does:
