🎯 Define MVP Goal

Students can order → pay securely → staff sees verified payment → food is served → data is tracked.

That’s it.

Everything else is secondary.

🔥 CORE MVP FEATURES (Must Have)
1️⃣ Authentication (MANDATORY)

Right now you have no auth.

For real deployment you need:

Student login (college email OR roll number)

Staff login (secure password)

Why?

Prevent anonymous spam orders

Link orders to real students

Handle refunds

Track misuse

✅ Minimum solution:
Firebase Authentication with email/password.

2️⃣ Proper Payment Gateway (MANDATORY)

Replace:

❌ UPI deep link
❌ Manual verification

With:

✔ Razorpay Checkout
✔ Server-side signature verification

Why?

Auto verification

No fake payments

Refund capability

Legal safety

3️⃣ Order-Payment Binding (MANDATORY)

Order should only become:

status = "Confirmed"

AFTER payment success.

Right now you create order before payment.

That is dangerous.

Better flow:

Student → Create "Pending Payment" order →
Open Razorpay →
On success → update order to "Paid"

4️⃣ Inventory Protection (Important)

If 10 samosas exist and 10 ordered:

System must prevent 11th order.

Otherwise chaos.

At least:

Manual stock count
OR

Basic stock decrement logic

5️⃣ Admin Panel (Minimal)

Admin should be able to:

View revenue

View total orders

Update menu

Change price

Disable item

Even basic controls are fine.

6️⃣ Secure Firebase Rules (MANDATORY)

Right now rules are probably open.

That is extremely dangerous.

You must:

Prevent random database writes

Allow only authenticated users

Restrict staff updates

🟡 SECONDARY FEATURES (Can Add Later)

Dietary filter

Donation system

Dynamic discount

Analytics dashboard

Predictive queue

These are enhancements.

Not MVP-critical.
